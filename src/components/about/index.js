        My career started building software for finance, as I worked in a
        quantitative investment management firm that specialized in modelling
        financial markets. Presently, I'm part of Marcura, where I work on a
        fintech platform for maritime payments featuring a digital wallet and
        in-house ledgering. Previously, I've been with Cisco, CERN, and
        CreightonAI. With a passion for learning and an insatiable curiosity, I
        rarely settle for comfort.
